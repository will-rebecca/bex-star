			<img class="tall-small about-a" src="images/art/rocket.jpeg" alt="Drawing of a boy riding a rocket across a cloudy sky">
			<br> <br> <br>
			<p>
				For this themed project, I created a cohesive set of three hand-drawn images that visually 
				connect through style and subject. <br>
				After completing the drawings, I scanned them and used Adobe Photoshop to enhance the colors, 
				refine details, and unify the overall look. <br>
				The result is a visually consistent trio that showcases both my traditional illustration skills 
				and digital editing techniques.
			</p>

			<h5>Skills utilized</h5>
			<ul>
				<li>Hand-drawn illustration techniques</li>
				<li>Composition and visual storytelling</li>
				<li>Adobe Photoshop: layers, color correction, and filters</li>
				<li>Scanning and digitizing artwork</li>
				<li>File formatting for print and digital display</li>
				<li>Time management and creative planning</li>
			</ul>

			<br> <br> <br>
			<p>
				This project was especially enjoyable because it allowed me to blend two of my favorite creative 
				processes—drawing by hand and refining artwork digitally. I loved the challenge of translating traditional 
				linework into polished digital art, and seeing how color and texture could transform the mood of the pieces. <br>
				It was a chance to experiment, be imaginative, and apply technical tools to bring my vision to life.

			<h3>Collage Project</h3>
			<img class="sm about-b" src="images/art/collage.jpeg" alt="A graphicly designed collage">
			<p>
				For this first project in my computer art class, I created a digital collage using Adobe Photoshop.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The goal was to combine multiple images into a single, cohesive composition. Since I was just 
				beginning to learn the software, this project helped me get comfortable with Photoshop’s interface and 
				basic tools like layers, masking, selection tools, and image adjustments.
			</p>
			<p>
				I explored how to blend elements together using opacity, filters, and layering effects to create a 
				surreal, mixed-media-inspired piece.
			</p>
			<h5>Skills Utilized</h5>
			<ul class="closer">
				<li>Image selection and composition planning</li>
				<li>Adobe Photoshop: layers, masking, transform tools</li>
				<li>Image adjustments: brightness, contrast, hue/saturation</li>
				<li>Use of blending modes and opacity</li>
				<li>Basic selection and cropping techniques</li>
				<li>Creative problem-solving and experimentation</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Travel Banner</h3>
			<p>
				For this travel banner project, I created a promotional design for Pantheon—a mysterious, 
				cloud-based realm where minds are uploaded by choice, at the moment of death.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was my first time using Adobe Illustrator, and I found the switch from Photoshop’s familiar 
				tools to Illustrator’s vector-based system challenging. <br>
				I used the pen tool, shape builder, and gradients to create a sleek, ethereal look.

			<h4>AppleWood Website</h4>
			<img class="xxsm a" src="images/art/apple.png" alt="A graphicly designed apple.">
			<p>
				In the early stages of my digital design journey, I worked on a project centered around a fictional website for a location of my choice—Applewood, Colorado.
				<br><br>
				I created a cohesive visual identity for the town by designing a custom logo with a matching color scheme inspired by the natural reds of apples, tying into both the name and local imagery.
				<br> <br> 
				I used a mix of photo editing applications to produce graphics and a short video animation that depicted a building under construction and a stylized apple forming over time.
				<br> <br> 
				This project helped me experiment with different tools and develop a basic understanding of visual branding, motion, and composition.
