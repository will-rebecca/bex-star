			<h3>The Relation Between Socioeconomic Status & Trauma</h3>
			<p class="summary-text">
				Trauma is a deeply distressing and or disruptive experience that can have lasting effects that 
				negatively impact a person’s well-being. While many students encounter difficulties during the 
				course of their academic adventure, those from lower-income households may have been disproportionately 
				exposed to traumatic experiences both before and also while they attended college.

			<h4>Methodologies</h4>
		</div>

		<div class="teal area grid-area">
			<div class="white mini-area">
				<h5>Research Design</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Hypothesis: We suggested that college students' trauma exposure related to their family income level.</li>
					<li>Survey-based Quantitative design</li>
					<li>Cross-sectional design</li>
					<li>Aimed to measure different traumas students might have undergone.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="white mini-area">
				<h5>Sample</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>The target population for this study included college students aged 18–25.</li>
					<li>Students were grouped based on the highest level of education attained by their parents; parents with less than high school education and no higher education</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="white mini-area">
				<h5>Data Collection Procedure</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Online QR code from Google Forms survey distributed through university mailing lists and word of mouth.</li>
					<li>Participation was voluntary, and responses remained anonymous to ensure confidentiality.</li>
					<li>Participants were informed about the study’s purpose and prompted with a disclaimer for the study’s demographic requirements before completing the survey.</li>
					<li>The ethical considerations included ensuring participants’ privacy and warning participants of sensitive information.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<div class="white mini-area">
				<h5>Measures & Survey</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>To assess trauma exposure, we used the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) test</li>
					<li>To capture experiences specific to LGBTQ+ individuals, we added adapted items from LGBTQ+ ACE tools</li>
					<li>Additional questions were incorporated to measure the experience of racial discrimination or trauma</li>
					<li>parental education will be collected through self-reported data on the level of education attained by the participant's parents. This served as a proxy for household income.</li>
				</ul>

			<h4>Research Findings</h4>
			<img class="med b" src="images/research/education-distribution.png" alt="">
			<p>
				The demographic data presents a valuable overview of student backgrounds, many of which show indicators 
				of economic or educational disadvantage.
			</p>

				<h5>Participant Demographic</h5>
				
				<ul class="closer">
					<li>A total of 38 college students participated</li>
					<li>75% (27) stated they were attending college full time</li>
					<li>54.1% (20 participants) identified with she/her pronouns</li>
					<li>75.7% (28) reported living with their parents</li>
					<li>48.6 (18) identified as first-generation college students</li>
				</ul>

			<h5>Data trends</h5>
			<p>
				Students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly those whose parents had not completed high school, 
				reported higher average trauma scores.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s important to note that there were relatively few participants who reported parental education levels at the 
				Associate, Doctorate, Some High School, or Elementary/Primary levels. This limited representation can introduce 
				skewness into the data, as averages based on very small sample sizes may not accurately reflect broader patterns.
