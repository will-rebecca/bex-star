            <h2>I'm Rebecca L Williams</h2>
            <p>Web Development Student | AI & UX Enthusiast | Creative Problem Solver | Passionate Learner</p>
            <p>
                My background is a blend of diverse experiences that fuel my passion for web and graphic design.
                Whether I am building something from scratch, collaborating on a project, or exploring a new idea, I bring 
                a mix of adaptability, cultural insight, and a love for storytelling into everything I do.
                This is a look into my journey–where I have been and where I am now.

            <h3>Curiosity & Perspective</h3>
            <p>
                I have always believed that movement shapes Perspective–and my life has been full of it. 
                I moved around a lot as a child, having lived in California, Spain, Romania, Colorado, and now Chicago. <br> <br>
                Each place has added a unique layer to who I am, broadening my worldview and feeding my curiosity about people, 
                culture, and creativity.
                This journey across continents and communities has deeply influenced the way I think, work and connect with others.

            <h3>DCI & WGI</h3>
            <p>
                Together, WGI and DCI represent the highest level of pageantry arts, blending athleticism, creativity, and passion 
                into unforgettable performances.
            </p>
            <p>
                DCI is a summer league that showcases elite marching ensembles–often featuring some of the most skilled color 
                guard performers in the world. Color guard, which originated as a visual extension of margin bands, has evolved into 
                its own art form both in WGI’s indoor season and indoor marching activities like DCI.

            <h3>My Journey in Color Guard</h3>
            <p>
                I began color guard in high school, where I fell in love with the art form and eventually became captain during my 
                senior year. That leadership experience sparked something in me, and on a whim, I auditioned for the Troopers Drum and 
                Bugle Corps–and earned a spot. That spontaneous decision led to three unforgettable summers performing with some of the 
                most passionate and dedicated people I’ve ever met.
            </p>
            <p>Those experiences shaped my resilience, deepened my love for performance, and taught me the value of showing up fully no 
                matter the conditions.</p>
